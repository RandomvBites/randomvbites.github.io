I.m a virtualization architect at a leading service provider, responsible for the VMware estate of the largest single VMware VSPP partner. This year I.m intending on building out this blog with useful information relating to both Virtualization and also other open source technologies I work with.

This blog represents my personal opinion only, and in no way represents my employers, past, present or future.
